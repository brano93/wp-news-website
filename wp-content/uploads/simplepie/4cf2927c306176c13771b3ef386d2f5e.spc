<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Why Build an Online Community?</h4>



<p>Building an online community can turn your <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/guides/" title="How to Make a WordPress Website (Ultimate Guide)">WordPress website</a> into an interactive space where visitors become active participants. Instead of just reading your content and leaving, users can connect and build relationships around your brand.</p>



<p>Here are the main benefits of creating an online community:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>More user engagement</strong>: Forums, groups, and member profiles give visitors specific, strong reasons to keep coming back to your community. </li>



<li><strong>Brand loyalty</strong>: Active community members often become your biggest supporters. This may involve taking positive actions like posting comments, engaging with you on <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/social-media-cheat-sheet-for-wordpress/" title="The Complete Social Media Cheat Sheet for WordPress (Updated)">social media</a>, or even buying your products. I&#8217;ve spoken to many store owners who say their community members are their best repeat customers.</li>



<li><strong>Your community creates valuable content for you:</strong> Every discussion and comment from your members is fresh, user-generated content for your website. Search engines are now giving higher rankings to this type of authentic content, which can improve your SEO and bring more visitors to your site. This is the same model that helps power popular communities like Reddit and Quora.</li>



<li><strong>Create revenue opportunities</strong>: You can set up new income sources like paid memberships, <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-create-online-course-in-wordpress/" title="How to Create and Sell Online Courses with WordPress (Step by Step)">online courses</a>, and members-only content. </li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Why Use WordPress for Your Online Community?</h5>



<p>Building your community on WordPress gives you full control. Everything, from your member data to your content, stays on your site instead of a hosted platform that can change its rules or shut down overnight.</p>



<p>It also keeps your community close to the rest of your website. Members can move easily between your blog, store, and online courses without having to log in to another platform.</p>



<p>Hosted platforms like Discord or Mighty Networks may seem easier at first, but you don’t own the platform, can’t customize it freely, and have to work around their pricing and feature limits. With WordPress, you set the rules and keep full control over how your community grows.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">My Testing Methodology for Evaluating Community Plugins</h4>



<p>Choosing the wrong community plugin can kill engagement before it even starts. I know this from personal experience: when I first tried to <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/5-best-forum-plugins-for-wordpress/" title="Best WordPress Forum Plugins (Compared)">launch a forum</a>, I ended up with silent, empty pages and zero activity.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t just look at a plugin&#8217;s list of features. Instead, I personally build test communities and put each plugin through real-life scenarios that mirror what you&#8217;ll face as a site owner.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s how I test every plugin in this review:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Installation and setup time</strong>: I track how long it takes me to get a basic community up and running. I also make a note of any technical roadblocks that might confuse someone who is just starting out.</li>



<li><strong>User experience testing</strong>: I always create a test member account and approach the community just like a new user would. This helps me check if the features feel easy to use, or if they&#8217;re confusing. </li>



<li><strong>Performance impact</strong>: I <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-properly-run-a-website-speed-test-best-tools/" title="How to Properly Run a Website Speed Test (Best Tools)">run a website speed test</a> before and after I install the plugin. This is because community features can slow down your site if they&#8217;re not set up properly.</li>



<li><strong>Mobile responsiveness</strong>: I test every feature on mobile devices, as most community interactions happen on phones and tablets.</li>



<li><strong>Scalability potential</strong>: I try to simulate what happens when a community grows quickly. In this way, I can see how each plugin handles lots of new members and content.</li>



<li><strong>Value for money:</strong> I compare total cost to capability: upfront license prices, any add-ons you’ll likely need, hosting requirements, and how much you can accomplish at each tier as your community grows.</li>
</ul>



<p>My main goal is to find plugins that are simple and work well for beginners, but can also grow with your community as you get more members. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.buddyboss.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="The BuddyBoss social network WordPress plugin">BuddyBoss</a> is the best community plugin for creating an &#8216;all-in-one&#8217; social network directly inside your WordPress site. It allows you to <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-make-a-social-media-website/" title="How to Make a Social Media Website (Beginner’s Guide)">build your own social media website</a>, including features such as detailed activity feeds, private messaging, profiles, groups, and events.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve tested BuddyBoss extensively, and it stands out for its clean, modern design and rich user-facing features. For more details, you can see my <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/solutions/buddyboss/" title="BuddyBoss">complete BuddyBoss review</a>.</p>


<div class="wpb-alert style-yellow">

<p><strong>Quick Note: </strong>Keep in mind that BuddyBoss costs more upfront than other options on this list, but I believe that you get a lot of value for money. Instead of juggling separate plugins for social feeds, groups, messaging, and gamification, you get everything in one integrated system. </p>



<p>When you factor in the time and setup savings, BuddyBoss is one of the best long-term investments for building a thriving online community.</p>

</div>


<h5 class="wp-block-heading">My Experience</h5>



<p>The initial setup process was very straightforward, and I didn&#8217;t need any technical expertise to get BuddyBoss up and running. I also really appreciated that the plugin looked great, right out of the box.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="384" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/buddyboss-activity-feed.png" alt="An example of a community site, created using BuddyBoss" class="wp-image-368108" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/buddyboss-activity-feed.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/buddyboss-activity-feed-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>When I tested its activity feeds, I was impressed by how seamlessly recent posts and comments flowed across all areas of my community. </p>



<p>I also liked that you can <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-run-a-virtual-class-for-free-with-wordpress/" title="How to Run a Virtual Classroom Online with WordPress">create an online school</a> with collaborative learning, gamification, and an engaging student dashboard to improve the learner experience.</p>



<p>Another benefit is that BuddyBoss allows you to turn your community website into an app. This can be a great option for boosting engagement and getting more signups.</p>



<p>Just keep in mind that BuddyBoss tends to use a lot of server resources, so you&#8217;ll need powerful WordPress hosting to run it well. I recommend using <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/rapyd-hosting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="The Rapyd Cloud BuddyBoss hosting">Rapyd Cloud hosting</a> since they have a plan designed specifically for BuddyBoss. </p>



<p><strong>Why I Recommend BuddyBoss:</strong> This plugin creates an easy-to-use social network experience for your visitors. In my opinion, BuddyBoss&#8217;s biggest strength is combining all the essential community features into one modern, well-integrated platform.</p>

<p>Unlike premium alternatives I&#8217;ve tested, BuddyPress focuses on providing a stable, solid foundation rather than lots of flashy features.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">My Experience</h5>



<p>I used BuddyPress to build a test site where WordPress fans could connect with each other. BuddyPress immediately gave me reliable features like group creation, friendship systems, and member notifications right out of the box.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="335" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/post-a-message-on-the-activity-page-in-buddypress.png" alt="Post a message on the activity page in BuddyPress" class="wp-image-370350" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/post-a-message-on-the-activity-page-in-buddypress.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/post-a-message-on-the-activity-page-in-buddypress-300x148.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>BuddyPress&#8217; core features worked very well, letting me create public, private, and hidden groups without any difficult setup.</p>



<p>I also easily integrated it with the free bbPress plugin to <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-add-a-forum-in-wordpress-with-bbpress/" title="How to Add a Forum in WordPress (2 Easy Methods)">add discussion forums</a> directly inside my social groups. I believe this combination is key, as it makes the community experience feel more complete. </p>



<p>Keep in mind that the default styling is basic, which I think is a fair trade-off for being free. For site owners who are comfortable with adding some minor styling changes, BuddyPress is a great option.</p>



<p><strong>Why I Recommend BuddyPress:</strong> This plugin gives you essential social features completely free. Overall, BuddyPress is perfect if you&#8217;re on a tight budget or just starting out.</p>

<p><a href="https://thrivethemes.com/comments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="The Thrive Comments WordPress comment plugin ">Thrive Comments</a> is the best solution for turning your regular blog comment section into an engaging community space.</p>



<p>Instead of the basic WordPress comments that most visitors simply ignore, Thrive creates an interactive environment where readers genuinely want to participate. For example, it includes comment likes / dislikes, comment badges, and more.</p>



<p>For more about our experience with Thrive Comments, see our <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/solutions/thrive-themes-suite/" title="Thrive Themes Suite">full Thrive Themes Suite review</a>. </p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">My Experience</h5>



<p>To test how well Thrive Comments performs, I loaded a review page that I had intentionally filled with over 300 comments. Thrive&#8217;s built-in lazy loading feature worked exactly as advertised, keeping the initial page load fast and snappy.</p>



<p>Plus, I liked that Thrive Comments includes handy <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/how-to-allow-users-to-like-or-dislike-comments-in-wordpress/" title="How to Allow Users to Like or Dislike Comments in WordPress">upvoting and downvoting features</a> that help highlight the most valuable responses. Quality comments naturally rise to the top, encouraging better discussions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="226" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/thrive-comments-wordpress.png" alt="An example of an enhanced comment system on a WordPress blog or website " class="wp-image-368112" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/thrive-comments-wordpress.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/thrive-comments-wordpress-300x100.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>During my testing, I also found Thrive&#8217;s built-in gamification system to be very effective at encouraging participation. </p>



<p>Users can earn badges based on their activity, which adds an element of fun that keeps people coming back to engage and see their progress.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="280" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/comment-badges.png" alt="Comment badges" class="wp-image-128365" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/comment-badges.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/comment-badges-300x124.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>I was also really impressed by the post-comment actions, which instantly turn engaged commenters into potential email subscribers. After someone leaves a thoughtful comment, you can automatically <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/redirect-your-users-attention-with-comment-redirect/" title="How to Redirect Your User’s Attention With Comment Redirect">redirect them to a special thank you page</a> or show them an optin form.</p>



<p><strong>Why I Recommend Thrive Comments:</strong> This plugin successfully turns your passive blog readers into active community members. Plus, its ability to <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/build-email-list-wordpress-optinmonster/" title="How to Build Your Email List in WordPress with OptinMonster">capture email subscribers</a> from your most engaged visitors is a huge bonus.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/accessally/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="AccessAlly">AccessAlly</a> is one of the most complete WordPress solutions for building online learning communities. Its <strong>CommunityAlly</strong> add-on allows you to set up group feeds, member profiles, and discussion areas directly inside your online course or membership area. </p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">My Experience</h5>



<p>To test AccessAlly, I tried building a small <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-offer-cohort-based-online-courses-wordpress-group-learning/" title="How to Offer Cohort-Based Online Courses — WordPress Group Learning">group learning community</a> with discussion groups linked to specific courses. Setting it up took more time than with simpler plugins, but the extra control over structure made it worth it. </p>



<p>Each group automatically added or removed members based on course enrollment, and users could post updates or start discussions inside their cohort. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="249" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/accessally-content-group.png" alt="Group automatically added to Content Pages" class="wp-image-329561" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/accessally-content-group.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/accessally-content-group-300x110.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>I also liked that AccessAlly includes strong gamification tools. I was able to award points when members completed lessons or participated in discussions, and set up leaderboards for each community. </p>



<p>Just keep in mind that AccessAlly is more expensive and complex than some of the other community plugins on this list. I think it could be worth it for larger companies or professional coaches, but it may not be the best fit for small businesses.</p>



<p><strong>Why I Recommend AccessAlly:</strong> It’s ideal for managing courses, memberships, and community spaces in one system. AccessAlly offers deeper engagement tools than most LMS or membership plugins, and its automation options make it easy to grow an active, loyal community over time.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Other Community Plugins I Tested</h4>



<p>If you’re still exploring your options, here are a few other plugins worth mentioning.</p>



<p>These didn’t make my top recommendations, but they can work well in specific situations or for smaller projects.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What Is the Best WordPress Community Plugin?</h4>



<p>The best plugin for you really depends on what kind of community you&#8217;re trying to build. This will vary depending on whether you want to focus on online training, selling premium content, creating a free social network, or something else entirely.</p>



<p>Here is a quick summary: </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>If you want to build a social network on WordPress</strong>, then <a href="https://www.buddyboss.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="The BuddyBoss social network WordPress plugin">BuddyBoss</a> is my top pick. It&#8217;s an all-in-one solution that promises to transform your site into an engaging community, similar to a private Facebook that you fully own. </li>



<li><strong>If you want to create a premium, paid community</strong>, then <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/memberpress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="The MemberPress membership plugin ">MemberPress</a> really stands out. It&#8217;s what I recommend if you need simple-to-use content restriction and powerful subscription management.</li>



<li><strong>If you want to focus on online learning</strong>, then <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/accessally/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="AccessAlly">AccessAlly</a> is my top pick. It allows you to build communities within your online courses and encourage group learning. </li>

</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Frequently Asked Questions About Online Communities</h4>



<p>Choosing the right tools for your online community can be confusing, so it&#8217;s completely normal to still have some questions. </p>



<p>To help you out, I&#8217;ve gathered answers to the most common questions our readers ask us about running a community on WordPress.</p>



<p><strong>Do I need special hosting for running online communities on WordPress?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, you’ll need reliable, high-performance hosting for running an active WordPress community. Community plugins process constant activity, like posts, messages, and notifications, that can quickly slow down basic shared hosting.</p>



<p>I recommend <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/rapyd-hosting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="Rapyd Hosting Homepage">Rapyd Cloud</a>. It’s built for high-traffic, dynamic websites and handled resource-heavy plugins like BuddyBoss smoothly in my tests.</p>



<p><strong>Can I monetize my WordPress community?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, absolutely! In my experience, the best way to <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/make-money-online/" title="Proven Ways to Make Money Online Blogging with WordPress">make money online</a> is by using a membership plugin to sell access to your content or community groups. </p>



<p>Tools like <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/memberpress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="MemberPress homepage">MemberPress</a> and <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/accessally/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="AccessAlly">AccessAlly</a> all provide the necessary features to handle this. These plugins offer simple subscription management, detailed content protection to lock down exclusive posts, and other features you need to run a successful paid community.</p>



<p><strong>Which is the best free WordPress community plugin?</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://buddypress.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="BuddyPress">BuddyPress</a> is the best free option. It&#8217;s open source and very well-documented by the larger WordPress community.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">More Resources for Building WordPress Communities</h4>



<p>My biggest advice is to remember that these plugins are just the starting point. Building a successful WordPress community requires finding the right mix of tools, smart hosting, and genuine engagement strategies. </p>



<p>With that said, I recommend using the resources below to improve your site and grow your brand-new community:</p>

<p>A fundraising thermometer can help with that by showing your fundraising progress visually. When donors see how close you are to your goal, they feel motivated to help you reach your target.</p>



<p>I’ve tested several WordPress fundraising plugins that can add this feature, and a few make it incredibly easy. They track total donations in real-time and work with any existing donation form or page.</p>



<p>In this guide, I’ll show you the quickest way to add a fundraising thermometer to your WordPress site so you can get more donations for your nonprofit. </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What Is a Fundraising Thermometer?</h4>



<p>A fundraising thermometer is a simple visual tool that shows how close you are to reaching your donation goal. It looks like a regular thermometer, and the bar fills up as more <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/opinion/donation-form-best-practices-to-boost-donations-in-wordpress/" title="Top Donation Form Best Practices to Boost Donations in WordPress">donations come in</a>.</p>



<p>It’s an easy and fun way to show supporters the progress of your campaign. </p>



<p>For example, if your goal is $5,000 and you’ve raised $2,500, the thermometer will show that you’re halfway there.</p>



<p>You can display a fundraising thermometer on your homepage, donation page, or in a campaign widget on the sidebar. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="362" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/preview-of-progress-bar-with-charitable.png" alt="Preview of a progress bar" class="wp-image-368497" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/preview-of-progress-bar-with-charitable.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/preview-of-progress-bar-with-charitable-300x160.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>You can even add it directly inside your <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-create-a-recurring-donation-form-in-wordpress-step-by-step/" title="How to Create a Recurring Donation Form in WordPress (Step by Step)">donation form</a> so that donors see the progress while giving. Or you can show on a separate page on your website to encourage more donations.</p>



<p>Depending on the plugin you use, it can also update automatically as donations are received, helping visitors see the progress in real time.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How Does a Fundraising Thermometer Boost Donations?</h4>



<p>A fundraising thermometer isn&#8217;t just a visual element. It&#8217;s a proven tool that increases donations. I’ve seen this work on many <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-create-a-nonprofit-website-in-wordpress/" title="How to Create a Nonprofit Website in WordPress (Step by Step)">nonprofit websites</a>, and there are a few reasons why:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Goal Gradient Effect: </strong>People like to see progress. That&#8217;s why when a campaign gets close to its goal, supporters feel more motivated to give. This psychological principle explains why campaigns often see increased activity as they near completion.</li>



<li><strong>Social Proof: </strong>When visitors see other people donating, it builds trust. They think, <em>“If others are giving, it must be worth it.”</em> That’s <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-use-fomo-on-your-wordpress-site-to-increase-conversions/" title="How to Use FOMO on Your WordPress Site to Increase Conversions">social proof</a> in action. </li>



<li><strong>Instant Motivation: </strong>A thermometer gives donors quick motivation. Seeing the bar rise after each donation feels rewarding and encourages more people to help. In fact, studies show that visual progress indicators like fundraising thermometers can <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/research/nonprofit-marketing-statistics-and-insights-you-should-know/" title="Nonprofit Marketing Statistics and Insights You Should Know">increase donations by 15–30%</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-step-1">Step 1: Install Charitable on Your WordPress Site</h5>



<p>First, you need to install and activate the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/charitable" target="_blank" title="Free version of WP Charitable - WordPress Donation Plugin">free Charitable plugin</a>. For details, just follow our tutorial on <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/step-by-step-guide-to-install-a-wordpress-plugin-for-beginners/" title="How to Install a WordPress Plugin – Step by Step for Beginners">installing a WordPress plugin</a>.</p>


<div class="wpb-alert style-yellow">

<p><strong>Note: </strong>Charitable offers a <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/charitable" target="_blank" title="Free version of WP Charitable - WordPress Donation Plugin">free plan</a>, which lets you add a fundraising thermometer (progress bar) to your donation forms.</p>



<p>However, if you want access to more campaign templates, extra payment gateways, and advanced features like peer-to-peer fundraising, I recommend upgrading to the <a href="https://www.wpcharitable.com" target="_blank" title="WP Charitable - Best WordPress Donation and Fundraising Plugin">Pro version</a>.</p>

</div>


<p>If you choose the Pro plugin, then you will also need to enter your license key. To do this, head over to the <strong>Charitable » Settings</strong> page from the WordPress dashboard and paste it into the &#8216;License Key&#8217; field. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="320" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/add-charitable-license-key.png" alt="Add your Charitable license key in the field" class="wp-image-370200" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/add-charitable-license-key.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/add-charitable-license-key-300x141.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>You can get this information from your account on the Charitable website.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-step-2">Step 2: Add a New Donation Campaign</h5>



<p>Now it’s time to create your first fundraising campaign. For this, go to the <strong>Charitable » Add New</strong> page from your WordPress dashboard.</p>



<p>Start by giving your campaign a name. I suggest choosing something short and clear, like &#8216;Help Build Our Community Library&#8217; or &#8216;Support Local Animal Rescue.&#8217; </p>



<p>This name will appear on your donation form and campaign page, so make sure it’s something your visitors can easily recognize.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="356" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/add-name-for-your-fundraising-form.png" alt="Add a name for your fundraising form in Charitable" class="wp-image-370202" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/add-name-for-your-fundraising-form.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/add-name-for-your-fundraising-form-300x157.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Next, choose a campaign template. Charitable offers several pre-built options, and each one has a different layout and goal style. </p>



<p>For example, you might see Animal Sanctuary, Disaster Relief, Medical Causes, or Environmental.</p>



<p>To find out if a template already includes a built-in fundraising thermometer, simply click the &#8216;Preview&#8217; button before selecting it. This helps you pick the design that fits your campaign best.</p>



<p>But if your chosen template doesn’t include a thermometer, don’t worry. You can easily add one to any template using the drag-and-drop builder.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="358" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/choose-template-in-charitable.png" alt="Choose a template for your fundraising form in Charitable" class="wp-image-370203" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/choose-template-in-charitable.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/choose-template-in-charitable-300x158.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Once the Campaign Builder opens up, you&#8217;ll see a form preview on the right with form fields in the left column. Simply drag and drop these fields to rearrange, edit, or remove them. </p>



<p>You can also add images, videos, and a short description to tell your story and inspire people to give.</p>



<p>Plus, you can customize fields like donation amount, donor name, email, and payment options to fit your campaign. Everything is editable, so you can design the form exactly how you want.</p>



<p>For more details, see our full tutorial on <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-create-a-recurring-donation-form-in-wordpress-step-by-step/" title="How to Create a Recurring Donation Form in WordPress (Step by Step)">how to create a recurring donation form in WordPress</a>. It explains how to add advanced fields and options to make your forms more flexible.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="343" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/customize-your-donation-form-in-charitable.jpg" alt="Customize your donation form in Charitable" class="wp-image-370205" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/customize-your-donation-form-in-charitable.jpg 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/customize-your-donation-form-in-charitable-300x150.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-step-3-add-and-customize-your-fund">Step 3: Add and Customize Your Fundraising Thermometer</h5>



<p>Charitable makes it super easy to add a fundraising thermometer to any of your donation forms. It comes with a built-in Progress Bar field that you can drag and drop into the form preview.</p>



<p>You can place it anywhere you want — at the top of the form (great for visibility), just above the donate button (to motivate donors before giving), or at the bottom (to wrap up the form with a sense of progress).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="322" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/add-progress-bar-field-in-donation-form-in-charitable.png" alt="Add the progress bar field in the donation form in Charitable" class="wp-image-370206" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/add-progress-bar-field-in-donation-form-in-charitable.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/add-progress-bar-field-in-donation-form-in-charitable-300x142.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Once you add the Progress Bar field, click on it to open its settings in the left column.</p>



<p>Here, you can start by adding a headline for your fundraising thermometer. This text appears right above your progress bar, so use something clear like &#8216;Our Goal So Far&#8217; or &#8216;Help Us Reach $5,000.&#8217;</p>



<p>This helps donors immediately understand what the bar represents.</p>



<p>Next, toggle on the switches for &#8216;Show Donated&#8217; and &#8216;Show Goal.&#8217; These options display your total raised amount and your overall goal.</p>



<p>When donors can see both the current amount raised and the target goal, they get a complete picture of your progress and understand exactly how their contribution will help you reach your fundraising target.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="285" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/configure-headline-and-campaign-info-for-fundraising-thermometer-in-charitable.png" alt="Configure headline and campaign information for the fundraising thermometer in Charitable" class="wp-image-370207" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/configure-headline-and-campaign-info-for-fundraising-thermometer-in-charitable.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/configure-headline-and-campaign-info-for-fundraising-thermometer-in-charitable-300x126.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>After that, scroll down to the ‘Goal Label’ field. This is the text that appears beside your fundraising thermometer to show donors what you’re aiming to achieve. </p>



<p>For example, you might write <em>Goal:</em> or <em>Our Target:</em>  </p>



<p>The actual goal amount (like $5,000) will appear automatically next to this label once you’ve set it up later in the settings.</p>



<p>Below that, you’ll see the ‘Donate Label’ field. This text appears next to the amount your campaign has already raised. You can customize it to say something like <em>Raised so far:</em> or <em>Donations collected:</em> depending on your tone or style. </p>



<p>The amount next to this label will update automatically every time a donation is received, so you don’t need to edit it manually.</p>



<p>You can also adjust the width and alignment options to make sure your fundraising thermometer fits seamlessly into your form’s layout.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="313" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/set-goal-label-for-fundraising-thermometer-in-charitable-1.png" alt="Set Goal Label for fundraising thermometer in Charitable" class="wp-image-370258" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/set-goal-label-for-fundraising-thermometer-in-charitable-1.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/set-goal-label-for-fundraising-thermometer-in-charitable-1-300x138.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Finally, switch to the &#8216;Advanced&#8217; tab at the top to customize the look of your thermometer. </p>



<p>Here, you can choose the style, size, and theme colors to match your website’s design or campaign branding.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-step-4">Step 4: Set a Goal for Your Fundraising Thermometer</h5>



<p>Now that your thermometer has been added to your donation form, it’s time to set your fundraising goal and configure other important campaign settings.</p>



<p>Switch to the <strong>Settings » General Settings</strong> tab from the left column. Here, you can set your fundraising goal in the &#8216;Goal&#8217; field. </p>



<p>This sets the target your thermometer will measure against. It updates automatically as donations come in, so donors see real-time progress.</p>



<p>I also suggest setting an end date for your campaign. Adding a clear deadline helps create a sense of urgency because people are more likely to donate when they know time is running out.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="292" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/set-a-goal-for-fundraising-thermometer-in-charitable.png" alt="Set a goal for your fundraising thermometer in Charitable" class="wp-image-370210" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/set-a-goal-for-fundraising-thermometer-in-charitable.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/set-a-goal-for-fundraising-thermometer-in-charitable-300x129.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Next, go to the <strong>Marketing </strong>tab to connect your campaign with your favorite <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-email-marketing-services/" title="Best Email Marketing Services for Small Businesses">email marketing service</a> like <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="Constant Contact" href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/constant-contact/" data-nojs="1" data-shortcode="true">Constant Contact</a>.</p>



<p>This lets you automatically follow up with donors, send thank-you emails, or share updates about your campaign’s progress.</p>


<div class="wpb-alert style-yellow">

<p>💡 <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Make sure your email notifications reach donors’ inboxes by setting up <a href="https://wpmailsmtp.com" target="_blank" title="WP Mail SMTP - Fix WordPress Email Deliverability">WP Mail SMTP</a>.

<p>Finally, switch to the <strong>Payments</strong> tab to connect your preferred payment gateways — such as Stripe, PayPal, or Braintree. Once connected, donors can securely give on your website through your donation form. </p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-step-5">Step 5: Launch Your Fundraiser Campaign</h5>



<p>Once your campaign looks good, it’s time to make it live. </p>



<p>To do this, switch the form to &#8216;Publish&#8217; and click the &#8216;Save&#8217; button to store your changes.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="332" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/make-your-fundraising-campaign-live-in-charitable-1.png" alt="Make your fundraising campaign live in Charitable" class="wp-image-370260" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/make-your-fundraising-campaign-live-in-charitable-1.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/make-your-fundraising-campaign-live-in-charitable-1-300x146.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>After that, you can <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-embed-forms-in-wordpress/" title="How to Embed Forms in WordPress (Ultimate Guide for Beginners)">embed your fundraising form</a> anywhere using the Charitable block in the block editor.</p>



<p>Just open any page or post, add the &#8216;Charitable Campaign&#8217; block, and select your campaign from the dropdown.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="349" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/add-charitable-campaign-block-to-page.png" alt="Add Charitable campaign block to a page" class="wp-image-370214" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/add-charitable-campaign-block-to-page.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/add-charitable-campaign-block-to-page-300x154.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>When you’re done, click the &#8216;Update&#8217; or &#8216;Publish&#8217; button to save your settings.</p>



<p>Here’s a quick preview of how your fundraising thermometer might look on your site:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="347" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/preview-of-fundraising-thermometer-with-charitable-1.png" alt="Preview of a fundraising thermometer in Charitable" class="wp-image-370261" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/preview-of-fundraising-thermometer-with-charitable-1.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/preview-of-fundraising-thermometer-with-charitable-1-300x153.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-step-6">Step 6: Manage and Track Your Fundraising Thermometer</h5>



<p>You can also easily monitor your campaign’s performance right from your WordPress dashboard.</p>



<p>Just go to <strong>Charitable » Donations</strong>, where you’ll see each campaign listed along with its fundraising thermometer showing real-time progress.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="328" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/view-campaigns-page-in-charitable.png" alt="View the Campaigns page in Charitable" class="wp-image-370216" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/view-campaigns-page-in-charitable.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/view-campaigns-page-in-charitable-300x145.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>You can also visit the <strong>Reports</strong> page to get a detailed overview of your fundraiser’s performance after adding the thermometer. </p>



<p>Here, you’ll find charts and key stats like total donations, total donors, average donation amount, and more — giving you a clear picture of how your campaign is doing.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="379" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/view-reports-page-in-charitable.png" alt="View the Reports page in Charitable" class="wp-image-370217" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/view-reports-page-in-charitable.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/view-reports-page-in-charitable-300x167.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>If you ever need to make changes, you can update your fundraising goal or extend the campaign’s end date from the campaign settings. </p>



<p>This flexibility helps you keep the momentum going and adjust your targets as your fundraiser grows.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-method-2-add-a-fundraising-thermometer-with-the-donation-thermometer-plugin-best-free-option">Method 2: Add a Fundraising Thermometer With the Donation Thermometer Plugin (Best Free Option)</h4>



<p>If you just want a quick and free way to show your fundraising progress, then the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/donation-thermometer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="Donation Thermometer">Donation Thermometer</a> plugin is a great pick. </p>



<p>It’s lightweight and super easy to use. Just note that you’ll need to manually update the amount raised as your donations come in.</p>



<p>I recommend this method for small community fundraisers, school projects, or personal charity drives that don’t require features like donor tracking or payment integrations.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-step-1">Step 1: Install and Activate the Donation Thermometer Plugin</h5>



<p>You can start by installing and activating the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/donation-thermometer" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="Donation Thermometer">Donation Thermometer</a> plugin. </p>



<p>To do this, head over to the <strong>Plugins » Add New</strong> page and search for &#8216;Donation Thermometer.&#8217;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="293" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/install-and-activate-donation-thermometer-plugin.png" alt="Install and activate the Donation Thermometer plugin" class="wp-image-370218" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/install-and-activate-donation-thermometer-plugin.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/install-and-activate-donation-thermometer-plugin-300x129.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>For detailed instructions, you can also see our guide on <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/step-by-step-guide-to-install-a-wordpress-plugin-for-beginners/" title="How to Install a WordPress Plugin – Step by Step for Beginners">how to install a WordPress plugin</a>.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-step-2">Step 2: Set Your Fundraising Targets</h5>



<p>Upon plugin activation, go to the <strong>Settings » Thermometer</strong> page from your WordPress dashboard. Here, you will set up the goal for your fundraising thermometer.</p>



<p>In the &#8216;Thermometer Values&#8217; section, start by entering your &#8216;Target Value&#8217;. This is the total amount you want to raise for your campaign (for example, 50000).</p>



<p>Next, enter your &#8216;Raised Value&#8217;, which shows how much has already been collected (for example, 25000). If you haven’t raised any money yet, you can leave this field blank for now. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="299" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/add-target-value-and-raised-value-for-your-fundraising-thermometer.png" alt="Add target and raised value for your fundraising thermometer" class="wp-image-370219" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/add-target-value-and-raised-value-for-your-fundraising-thermometer.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/add-target-value-and-raised-value-for-your-fundraising-thermometer-300x132.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Just keep in mind that this plugin does not update the raised amount automatically.</p>



<p>Each time you receive a donation, you will need to return to the settings page. Then, manually update the ‘Raised Value’ field to reflect your current progress.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-step">Step 3: Customize the Appearance of Your Fundraising Thermometer</h5>



<p>After setting your fundraising goal and raised amount, it’s time to adjust a few key settings that make your thermometer easy to read and visually appealing.</p>



<p>Start with the thermometer orientation.</p>



<p>You can choose portrait (vertical) or landscape (horizontal). Portrait is typically the better choice since it resembles the classic thermometer design that donors instantly recognize and expect.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="294" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/configure-fundraising-thermometer-orientation.png" alt="Configure your fundraising thermometer orientation" class="wp-image-370223" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/configure-fundraising-thermometer-orientation.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/configure-fundraising-thermometer-orientation-300x130.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Next, make sure to show the percentage, target, and amount raised by selecting &#8216;True&#8217; from the dropdown menu.</p>



<p>The percentage gives donors a quick visual look at how close you are to your goal, while the target and raised amounts provide transparency and help build trust.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="271" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/show-your-percentage-in-the-fundraising-thermometer.png" alt="Show your percentage in the fundraising thermometer" class="wp-image-370224" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/show-your-percentage-in-the-fundraising-thermometer.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/show-your-percentage-in-the-fundraising-thermometer-300x120.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>After that, pick a fill color for the thermometer so it stands out on your page.</p>



<p>You can also add a second fill color if you want a subtle gradient effect.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="369" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/customize-colors-for-your-fundraising-thermometer.png" alt="Customize colors for your fundraising thermometer" class="wp-image-370225" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/customize-colors-for-your-fundraising-thermometer.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/customize-colors-for-your-fundraising-thermometer-300x163.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Finally, adjust the number formatting to keep your amounts clean and easy to read.</p>



<p>This includes setting your currency symbol (like <code>$</code>), choosing a thousands separator (<code>,</code> is easiest to read), and setting decimal places (usually <code>0</code> for whole numbers).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="311" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/configure-currency-value-for-fundraising-thermometer.png" alt="Configure currency value for your fundraising thermometer" class="wp-image-370226" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/configure-currency-value-for-fundraising-thermometer.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/configure-currency-value-for-fundraising-thermometer-300x137.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>These simple adjustments are enough to create a professional-looking thermometer that clearly communicates your fundraising progress. But I recommend taking a look at the other settings and customizing them to your liking.</p>



<p>Once you’re happy with everything, click the &#8216;Save Changes&#8217; button to store your settings.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-step-4">Step 4: Add the Thermometer to Your Site</h5>



<p>Now it’s time to put your fundraising thermometer where your visitors can see it. Since this plugin only displays a thermometer and doesn’t include a donation form, I recommend adding it to your sidebar for maximum engagement. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/12-wordpress-sidebar-tricks-to-get-maximum-results/" title="WordPress Sidebar Tricks to Get Maximum Results">Sidebars</a> are typically displayed on most pages, so visitors can easily track your progress while browsing your site.</p>



<p>To do this, go to the <strong>Appearance » Widgets </strong>from your WordPress dashboard. Once there, expand the Sidebar section, and add the &#8216;Shortcode&#8217; block from the menu on the left.</p>



<p>Then, paste the following shortcode to display your thermometer. </p>


<div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code "><pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate">
&#x5B;thermometer]
</pre></div>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="302" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/add-shortcode-to-display-your-fundraising-thermometer.png" alt="Add the shortcode to display your fundraising thermometer" class="wp-image-370227" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/add-shortcode-to-display-your-fundraising-thermometer.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/add-shortcode-to-display-your-fundraising-thermometer-300x133.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>After that, click the &#8216;Update&#8217; button to store your settings.</p>



<p>This is how your fundraising thermometer will appear on your website.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="343" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/preview-of-a-simple-fundraising-thermometer.png" alt="Preview of a simple fundraising thermometer" class="wp-image-370228" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/preview-of-a-simple-fundraising-thermometer.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/preview-of-a-simple-fundraising-thermometer-300x150.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Keep in mind that if you’re using a <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-wordpress-full-site-editing-themes/" title="Best Block Themes for Full Site Editing in WordPress">block theme</a>, the classic <strong>Widgets</strong> menu won’t appear in your dashboard. In that case, head over to <strong>Appearance » Editor</strong> and open your Homepage template. </p>



<p>This will open the Full Site Editor on your screen. Here, click the + icon to open the block menu, and drag and drop the &#8216;Shortcode&#8217; block wherever you want your thermometer to appear. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="302" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/add-fundraising-thermometer-shortcode-in-fse.png" alt="Add fundraising thermometer shortcode in the FSE" class="wp-image-370229" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/add-fundraising-thermometer-shortcode-in-fse.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/add-fundraising-thermometer-shortcode-in-fse-300x133.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Paste the following shortcode into the block and click &#8216;Save&#8217; at the top.</p>


<div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code "><pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate">
&#x5B;thermometer]
</pre></div>


<p>Now, you can visit your site to see how your fundraising thermometer looks.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="353" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/fundraising-thermometer-preview-in-block-theme.png" alt="Fundraising thermometer preview in a block theme" class="wp-image-370230" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/fundraising-thermometer-preview-in-block-theme.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/fundraising-thermometer-preview-in-block-theme-300x156.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>

<p>Unlike dedicated donation plugins, it isn’t solely focused on fundraising. If your main goal is just a donation form, it might be overkill.</p>

<p>Then, go to the <strong>Formidable »</strong> <strong>Global Settings</strong> page and enter your license key. You can find this information in your Formidable Forms account on their website.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="344" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/add-license-key-in-formidable-forms.png" alt="Add the license key in Formidable Forms" class="wp-image-370237" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/add-license-key-in-formidable-forms.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/add-license-key-in-formidable-forms-300x152.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Next, head to the <strong>Formidable » Add-Ons</strong> screen in your WordPress dashboard. Here, you need to find the &#8216;Visual Views&#8217; addon and switch the toggle to activate it.</p>



<p>This add-on is the key to displaying your donations in a beautiful fundraising thermometer. It takes the form data — including each donation — and shows it as a progress bar that updates automatically.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="307" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/install-visual-views-addon-in-formidable-forms.png" alt="Install the Visual Views addon in Formidable Forms" class="wp-image-370236" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/install-visual-views-addon-in-formidable-forms.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/install-visual-views-addon-in-formidable-forms-300x135.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>With Visual Views, you can fully customize how your thermometer looks and where it appears on your site, giving you both functionality and flexibility for your fundraiser.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-step-2-add-and-configure-a-payment-gateway">Step 2: Add and Configure a Payment Gateway</h5>



<p>Since you’re already in the <strong>Add-Ons</strong> section, I also recommend installing your preferred payment add-on.</p>



<p>This step is important because I&#8217;m going to show you how to create a donation form that comes with a built-in payment field. Connecting a payment gateway ensures that people can actually donate through the form. </p>



<p>Formidable Forms supports popular options like <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/opinion/stripe-vs-paypal-wordpress/" title="Stripe vs. PayPal: Which Is Better for Your WordPress Site?">Stripe and PayPal</a>, so you can choose what works best for your nonprofit or fundraiser.</p>



<p>For most users, Stripe is the easiest choice. It handles multiple payment types, like credit and debit cards, Apple Pay, and Google Pay, and keeps donations secure.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="346" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/install-stripe-addon-in-formidable-forms.png" alt="Install the Stripe addon in Formidable Forms" class="wp-image-370238" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/install-stripe-addon-in-formidable-forms.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/install-stripe-addon-in-formidable-forms-300x153.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>After activating the add-on, navigate to the <strong>Formidable » Global Settings <strong>»</strong> Payments</strong> page from the dashboard and click the &#8216;Connect to Stripe&#8217; button.</p>



<p>You can now link your account to Formidable Forms.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="327" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/click-connect-to-stripe-button-in-formidable-forms.png" alt="Click the Connect to Stripe button in Formidable Forms" class="wp-image-370239" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/click-connect-to-stripe-button-in-formidable-forms.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/click-connect-to-stripe-button-in-formidable-forms-300x144.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Once completed, you’ll be redirected back to WordPress, and a green checkmark will confirm that your Stripe account is connected successfully. </p>



<p>Now, donations collected through your charity template will update your fundraising thermometer automatically.  </p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-step-3">Step 3: Use the Charity Tracker Template</h5>



<p>Now, it’s time to install the Formidable Forms Charity Tracker Application Template. I’ve tried this template with a few demo campaigns, and it really cuts down on setup time.</p>



<p>It automatically creates all the components you need to start fundraising quickly:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Donation and charity forms</strong> – to collect donor information and track donations.</li>



<li><strong>Thermometer, circle, and horizontal progress bar views</strong> – to visually display fundraising progress.</li>



<li><strong>Pre-built pages for donations and progress tracking</strong> – ready to publish or customize.</li>
</ul>



<p>To get started, go to the <strong>Formidable » Applications</strong> page and find the &#8216;Charity Tracker&#8217; template.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="314" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/add-charity-tracker-application-in-formidable-forms.png" alt="Add the Charity Tracker application in Formidable Forms" class="wp-image-370240" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/add-charity-tracker-application-in-formidable-forms.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/add-charity-tracker-application-in-formidable-forms-300x139.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Here, click the &#8216;Add&#8217; button.</p>



<p>This will open a popup, where you’ll need to click &#8216;Install Application.&#8217;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="369" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/click-install-application-button-in-formidable-forms.png" alt="Click the Install Application button in Formidable Forms" class="wp-image-370241" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/click-install-application-button-in-formidable-forms.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/click-install-application-button-in-formidable-forms-300x163.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Once you do that, another popup will appear asking you to name your application. </p>



<p>You can use any name that helps you recognize your campaign later if you ever want to edit or delete it. After that, click the &#8216;Install Application&#8217; button again to confirm.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="314" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/add-a-name-for-your-application-in-formidable-forms.png" alt="Add a name for your application in Formidable Forms" class="wp-image-370242" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/add-a-name-for-your-application-in-formidable-forms.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/add-a-name-for-your-application-in-formidable-forms-300x139.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Formidable Forms will now create your full charity tracking setup, which includes:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Charity Details Form</li>



<li>Charity Donation Form</li>



<li>Charity Donation Horizontal Progress Bar</li>



<li>Charity Donation Circle Progress Bar</li>



<li>Charity Donation Thermometer Progress Bar</li>



<li>Charity Donation Submission Page</li>



<li>Charity Progress Trackers Page</li>
</ul>



<p>Each of these components is already linked and ready to use. From here, simply click the &#8216;Open Application&#8217; button. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="346" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/click-open-application-button-in-formidable-forms.png" alt="Click the Open Application button in Formidable Forms" class="wp-image-370243" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/click-open-application-button-in-formidable-forms.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/click-open-application-button-in-formidable-forms-300x153.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>This will take you inside your newly created application, where you can see your forms, pages, and progress bar views.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-step-4">Step 4: Set Your Charity and Fundraising Goal</h5>



<p>Now that your template is set up, it’s time to configure the forms that power your fundraising thermometer.</p>



<p>I recommend starting with the Charity Details form since this is where you’ll define your campaign’s name and fundraising goal. </p>



<p>To do that, go to the <strong>Formidable » Entries</strong> page. You’ll see both the Charity Details and Charity Donation forms already created for you.</p>



<p>Here, click &#8216;Edit&#8217; under the Charity Details form to open it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="334" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/click-edit-link-under-charity-details-in-formidable-forms.png" alt="Click Edit link under Charity Details in Formidable Forms" class="wp-image-370244" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/click-edit-link-under-charity-details-in-formidable-forms.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/click-edit-link-under-charity-details-in-formidable-forms-300x147.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>This will take you to a new screen where you can enter a Charity Name — for example, the name of your cause or campaign. You can also set your Charity Goal, which is the total amount you want to raise.</p>



<p>Keep in mind that this form is for internal use only. Visitors won’t see it, so it&#8217;s just for you or your team to manage and update.</p>



<p>Once you’ve entered your details, click the &#8216;Update&#8217; button to save your settings.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="336" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/configure-charity-goal-in-formidable-forms.png" alt="Configure charity goal in Formidable Forms" class="wp-image-370245" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/configure-charity-goal-in-formidable-forms.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/configure-charity-goal-in-formidable-forms-300x148.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Next, you&#8217;ll need to check the entry for the Charity Donation form. On this same page, click the ‘Edit’ link under the ‘Charity Donation’ form.</p>



<p>Here, make sure that the ‘Status’ field is set to ‘Approved’ from the dropdown menu. </p>



<p>This ensures that test or pending donations will appear correctly on your fundraising thermometer once they come in.</p>



<p>You don’t need to adjust any other settings in this form because it’s already set up to work with the Charity Tracker template.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="352" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/configure-entry-status-as-approved-in-formidable-forms.png" alt="Configure entry status as approved in Formidable Forms" class="wp-image-370246" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/configure-entry-status-as-approved-in-formidable-forms.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/configure-entry-status-as-approved-in-formidable-forms-300x155.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Next, go back to the <strong>Formidable » Applications</strong> page. Now it’s time to customize your Charity Donation Thermometer Progress Bar.</p>



<p>Formidable gives you three styles to choose from: a thermometer, a horizontal bar, or a circle progress bar. </p>



<p>I prefer the thermometer view because it’s visually engaging and instantly communicates progress toward your goal.</p>



<p>Click the &#8216;Edit&#8217; link under the Charity Donation Thermometer Progress Bar.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="265" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/click-edit-under-donation-thermometer-progress-bar-in-formidable-forms.png" alt="Click the Edit link under Donation Thermometer Progress Bar" class="wp-image-370247" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/click-edit-under-donation-thermometer-progress-bar-in-formidable-forms.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/click-edit-under-donation-thermometer-progress-bar-in-formidable-forms-300x117.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>This will open the Formidable Views builder, where you can adjust the thermometer’s appearance. </p>



<p>From the left-hand panel, you can customize its typography, background color, border radius, padding, and more to match your site’s branding.</p>



<p>The best part? The thermometer is already linked to your donation form — so you don’t need to manually connect it or configure any extra settings. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="351" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/customize-fundraising-thermometer-in-formidable-forms.png" alt="Customize the fundraising thermometer in Formidable Forms" class="wp-image-370248" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/customize-fundraising-thermometer-in-formidable-forms.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/customize-fundraising-thermometer-in-formidable-forms-300x155.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Once you’re happy with how it looks, click the &#8216;Update&#8217; button at the top to save your changes.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-step-5">Step 5: Display Your Donation Form and Thermometer</h5>



<p>Now it’s time to display your donation form and fundraising thermometer on your website.</p>



<p>To do this, go to the <strong>Formidable » Applications</strong> page and click the &#8216;Edit&#8217; link under Charity Donation Submission. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="312" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/edit-charity-donation-submission-page-in-formidable-forms.png" alt="Edit charity donation submission page in Formidable Forms" class="wp-image-370249" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/edit-charity-donation-submission-page-in-formidable-forms.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/edit-charity-donation-submission-page-in-formidable-forms-300x138.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>This will open the block editor, where you’ll see that your donation form has already been added automatically.</p>



<p>Next, open the block menu from the left column and search for the &#8216;Formidable Views&#8217; block. Drag and drop it into your page. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="353" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/donation-form-already-added-in-formidable-forms.png" alt="Donation form already added by default" class="wp-image-370250" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/donation-form-already-added-in-formidable-forms.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/donation-form-already-added-in-formidable-forms-300x156.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Once it’s added, use the dropdown inside the block to select the fundraising thermometer you created earlier.</p>



<p>When you’re happy with the layout, click the &#8216;Publish&#8217; button at the top to save your changes.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="301" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/add-formidable-view-bloxk.png" alt="Add Formidable Views block" class="wp-image-370251" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/add-formidable-view-bloxk.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/add-formidable-view-bloxk-300x133.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>That’s it — your donation form and fundraising thermometer are now live on your site.</p>



<p>I recommend visiting your WordPress site to preview the page and make sure everything looks the way you want. </p>



<p>You should see both the donation form and the fundraising thermometer displayed on the same page, updating automatically as new donations come in.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="312" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/fundraising-thermometers-in-formidable-forms.gif" alt="Fundraising thermometers in Formidable Forms" class="wp-image-370252"/></figure>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-frequently-asked-questions-about-adding-fundraising-thermometers">Frequently Asked Questions About Adding Fundraising Thermometers in WordPress</h4>



<p>Adding a fundraising thermometer to your site is pretty straightforward, but I&#8217;ve been asked a few questions about how they work and what you can do with them.</p>



<p>Here are some quick FAQs to clear things up.</p>



<p><strong>Does a fundraising progress bar update automatically when donations are received?</strong></p>



<p>Yes! Most WordPress fundraising plugins, including Charitable and Formidable Forms, automatically update the thermometer in real time whenever a donation is made. This means your donors always see the current progress.</p>



<p>However, if you use a simpler tool like the Donation Thermometer plugin, you will need to update the amount manually.</p>



<p><strong>Can I have multiple fundraising thermometers for different campaigns?</strong></p>



<p>Absolutely. You can create as many thermometers as you need for different campaigns, each with its own goal, style, and placement on your site.</p>



<p><strong>What payment methods does Charitable support?</strong></p>



<p>Charitable integrates with popular payment gateways like Stripe and PayPal, making it easy to securely accept donations directly on your site.</p>



<p><strong>Can I track offline donations in my fundraising thermometer?</strong></p>



<p>Yes. You can manually add offline donations so that your thermometer accurately reflects all contributions, not just online ones.</p>



<p><strong>Is there a limit to how many fundraising campaigns I can create with Charitable?</strong></p>



<p>No. You can run multiple campaigns simultaneously, allowing you to manage and track different fundraising goals at the same time.</p>

<p>That’s why I recommend showing real WordPress.org reviews and ratings directly on your own website. Seeing authentic feedback from existing users can help new visitors feel confident about choosing your plugin or theme. </p>



<p>It’s a simple addition that can instantly boost credibility and conversions.</p>



<p>In this guide, I’ll show you how to display live WordPress.org plugin and theme reviews on your site — no coding required. </p>

<p><strong>TL;DR: </strong>Use <a href="https://smashballoon.com/reviews-feed" target="_blank" title="Smash Balloon Reviews Feed - #1 Customer Reviews Plugin for WordPress">Smash Balloon Reviews Feed Pro</a> to embed WordPress.org plugin and theme reviews directly into your WordPress website.</p>

</div>


<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Why Embed WordPress.org Reviews on Your WordPress Website?</h4>



<p>Showing your WordPress.org reviews on your website is one of the easiest ways to get more installs and sales for your plugin or theme.</p>



<p>People trust what other users say more than any marketing message. So, when visitors see real ratings and <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-user-feedback-plugins-for-wordpress/" title="Best User Feedback Plugins for WordPress (Free and Paid)">feedback</a> from WordPress.org right on your site, it reassures them that your product is legitimate. </p>



<p>Plus, they don’t have to leave your website to check the reviews because the proof is right there. That means visitors stay longer on your site, which can lead to <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-increase-pageviews-and-reduce-bounce-rate-in-wordpress/" title="How to Increase Pageviews and Reduce Bounce Rate in WordPress">more pageviews</a> and engagement.</p>



<p>Here are other ways that embedding WordPress.org reviews can help you:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list is-style-check">
<li><strong>Builds instant trust</strong> — Real <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-customer-reviews-plugins-for-wordpress-compared/" title="Best Customer Reviews Plugins for WordPress Compared">reviews</a> show that others already use and love your product. This can convince them to click &#8220;Install&#8221; or &#8220;Buy&#8221;.</li>



<li><strong>Highlights your strengths</strong> — Reviews often mention ease of use, support quality, or performance (things that persuade new users).</li>



<li><strong>Keeps <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-social-proof-wordpress-plugins-easy-to-use/" title="Best Social Proof Plugins for WordPress &amp; WooCommerce">social proof</a> fresh</strong> — Reviews update automatically, showing visitors your product is active and reliable.</li>
</ul>



<p>Now, I&#8217;ll walk you through how to show WordPress.org plugin and theme reviews on your site. </p>



<p>Here&#8217;s everything I&#8217;ll cover in this guide:</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="269" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/reviewsfeedpro-license.png" alt="Verifying the Reviews Feed Pro plugin's license key" class="wp-image-357938" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/reviewsfeedpro-license.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/reviewsfeedpro-license-300x119.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-step-2-create-a-new-review-feed">Step 2: Create a New Review Feed</h4>



<p>Now it&#8217;s time to set up your first review feed.</p>



<p>Navigate to <strong>Reviews Feed » All Feeds</strong> in your WordPress dashboard and click the &#8216;Add New&#8217; button. This will open the feed creation wizard, which will guide you through connecting to WordPress.org.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="296" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/reviewsfeedpro-creating-reviews-feed.png" alt="Creating a reviews feed on your WordPress website" class="wp-image-357941" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/reviewsfeedpro-creating-reviews-feed.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/reviewsfeedpro-creating-reviews-feed-300x131.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>From here, you can see that the plugin supports multiple review platforms, including <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/how-to-show-google-facebook-and-yelp-reviews-in-wordpress/" title="How I Show Google, Facebook, and Yelp Reviews in WordPress">Google, Facebook, and Yelp</a>. But for this tutorial, I&#8217;m focusing specifically on WordPress.org plugin and theme reviews.</p>



<p>So, from the list of available review sources, let&#8217;s select &#8216;WordPress.org&#8217; and click &#8216;Next&#8217;.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="434" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/reviewsfeedpro-addnew-addresources-wordpressorg.png" alt="Choosing WordPress.org as the review source" class="wp-image-368757" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/reviewsfeedpro-addnew-addresources-wordpressorg.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/reviewsfeedpro-addnew-addresources-wordpressorg-300x191.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>The setup wizard will now prepare to connect your feed to WordPress.org&#8217;s review system.</p>



<p>This connection allows the plugin to automatically pull in fresh reviews from any WordPress.org plugin or theme page that you specify.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-step-3-connect-your-wordpress-org-account">Step 3: Add Your WordPress.org Plugin or Theme as a Source</h4>



<p>To connect your review feed to specific WordPress.org reviews, you&#8217;ll need to provide <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/website-url-parts-explained-for-beginners/" title="What Is a Website URL (Important Parts Explained for Beginners)">the URL</a> of the plugin or theme with the reviews you want to display.</p>



<p>You can open a new browser tab and navigate to the WordPress.org page for your chosen plugin or theme.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s say you want to show reviews for a <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/5-best-contact-form-plugins-for-wordpress-compared/" title="I Tried Best WordPress Contact Form Plugins &amp; Here Are My Top Picks">contact form plugin</a>.</p>



<p>Simply go to that plugin&#8217;s official WordPress.org page and copy the complete URL from your browser&#8217;s address bar.</p>



<p>For example, the correct URL for the WPForms plugin is <code>https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpforms-lite/</code>. </p>



<p>Make sure you copy the link from the main page, not from the reviews or support tabs.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="378" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/wordpressorg-wpforms-plugin-url.png" alt="Copying a plugin's WordPress.org URL" class="wp-image-368759" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/wordpressorg-wpforms-plugin-url.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/wordpressorg-wpforms-plugin-url-300x167.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>This specific web address is like a map pointer, telling the plugin exactly where to find the right reviews for your product.</p>



<p>You can now return to your WordPress dashboard, paste the URL into the &#8216;Page URL&#8217; field, and then click &#8216;Finish&#8217;.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="281" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/reviewsfeedpro-addnew-addresources-wordpressorg-url.png" alt="Entering the plugins' URL into the Page URL field" class="wp-image-368760" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/reviewsfeedpro-addnew-addresources-wordpressorg-url.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/reviewsfeedpro-addnew-addresources-wordpressorg-url-300x124.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>


<div class="wpb-alert style-blue">

<p><strong>🧑‍💻</strong> <strong>Pro Tip: </strong>The process works exactly the same whether you&#8217;re displaying plugin or theme reviews. Just make sure you&#8217;re copying the URL from the correct WordPress.org page.</p>

</div>


<p>Once connected, Reviews Feed Pro will automatically sync with WordPress.org to pull in the latest reviews for your chosen plugin or theme.</p>



<p>This ensures your displayed reviews stay current without any manual updates needed.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="331" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/reviewsfeedpro-addnew-wordpressorg-asresource.png" alt="WordPress.org link added" class="wp-image-368762" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/reviewsfeedpro-addnew-wordpressorg-asresource.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/reviewsfeedpro-addnew-wordpressorg-asresource-300x146.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>From here, just click &#8216;Next&#8217; to start customizing your reviews feed.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-step-4-customize-your-reviews-feed">Step 4: Customize Your Reviews Feed</h4>



<p>Reviews Feed Pro automatically generates a feed that matches your website&#8217;s existing design, but you can customize it to fit your needs.</p>



<p>You can start by selecting from the available pre-built templates. These templates provide different layouts and styling options that work well with most <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-wordpress-themes/" title="Most Popular and Best WordPress Themes (Expert Pick)">WordPress themes</a>.</p>



<p>After that, click &#8216;Next&#8217; to continue.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="436" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/reviewsfeedpro-wordpressorg-review-template.png" alt="Choosing WordPress.org reviews feed template" class="wp-image-368764" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/reviewsfeedpro-wordpressorg-review-template.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/reviewsfeedpro-wordpressorg-review-template-300x192.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>On the next screen, you&#8217;ll see the visual customizer, where you can adjust your feed&#8217;s appearance.</p>



<p>Here, you can modify the header section, button styles, and individual review elements like <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-star-rating-plugins-for-wordpress/" title="Best Star Rating Plugins for WordPress (Compared)">star ratings</a> and user avatars. Every change you make appears instantly in the live preview panel on the right side of your screen.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="309" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/reviewsfeededitor-wordpressorg-editor.png" alt="Reviews Feed Pro editor for WordPress org reviews" class="wp-image-369715" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/reviewsfeededitor-wordpressorg-editor.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/reviewsfeededitor-wordpressorg-editor-300x136.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>For example, if you go to the &#8216;Layout&#8217; section, you can choose between 3 main layout styles:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>List</strong> – Reviews stacked vertically</li>



<li><strong>Masonry</strong> – Pinterest-style grid</li>



<li><strong>Carousel</strong> – Sliding reviews</li>
</ul>



<p>Don&#8217;t worry if you&#8217;re not sure which one to choose, because you can see how it looks in the preview.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="368" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/reviewsfeedpro-wordpressorg-editor-layout-list.png" alt="WordPress org reviews layout" class="wp-image-369717" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/reviewsfeedpro-wordpressorg-editor-layout-list.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/reviewsfeedpro-wordpressorg-editor-layout-list-300x162.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Next, one of my favorite features is the filtering system in the &#8216;Settings&#8217; tab.</p>



<p>It lets you filter reviews by star rating to show only 4-5 star reviews, or use keyword filtering to display reviews that mention specific terms. There&#8217;s even a banned words filter to exclude reviews containing specific phrases.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="388" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/reviewsfeedpro-wordpressorg-editor-filters.png" alt="Reviews Feed's filtering options" class="wp-image-369720" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/reviewsfeedpro-wordpressorg-editor-filters.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/reviewsfeedpro-wordpressorg-editor-filters-300x171.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>For complete control, you can manually moderate which reviews appear on your <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/guides/" title="How to Make a WordPress Website (Ultimate Guide)">WordPress site</a>.</p>



<p>This is especially helpful if you want to curate the most relevant and helpful reviews for your audience. For instance, you can use it to highlight reviews that discuss a specific feature you want to promote or mention your excellent customer support.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="369" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/reviewsfeedpro-wordpressorg-editor-moderation.png" alt="Enabling reviews moderation in Reviews Feed Pro" class="wp-image-369722" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/reviewsfeedpro-wordpressorg-editor-moderation.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/reviewsfeedpro-wordpressorg-editor-moderation-300x163.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-step-5-display-the-reviews-on-your-website">Step 5: Display the Reviews on Your Website</h4>



<p>When you&#8217;re satisfied with your feed&#8217;s appearance, click the &#8216;Embed&#8217; button in the top-right corner of the customizer. </p>



<p>This opens your embedding options.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="313" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/reviewsfeededitor-editor-embedbutton.png" alt="The Embed button in Reviews Feed Pro" class="wp-image-369726" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/reviewsfeededitor-editor-embedbutton.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/reviewsfeededitor-editor-embedbutton-300x138.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>You have three ways to display your reviews:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Add to a Page</strong> lets you embed reviews directly into any existing <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/what-is-the-difference-between-posts-vs-pages-in-wordpress/" title="What Is the Difference Between Posts vs. Pages in WordPress?">post or page</a>. This is perfect for product pages or detailed plugin reviews.</li>



<li><strong>Add to a Widget</strong>&nbsp;allows you to show reviews in your sidebar, footer, or any other widget area. This works well for <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-add-rotating-testimonials-in-wordpress/" title="How to Add Rotating Testimonials in WordPress">displaying testimonials</a> site-wide.</li>



<li><strong>Copy Shortcode</strong>&nbsp;gives you a <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-add-a-shortcode-in-wordpress/" title="How to Add a Shortcode in WordPress (Beginner’s Guide)">shortcode</a> that you can paste anywhere on your site. This option provides the most flexibility for custom placements.</li>
</ul>



<p>For this example, let&#8217;s add reviews to a page – choose &#8216;Add to a Page.&#8217;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="393" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/reviewsfeededitor-wordpressorg-embedfeed-page.png" alt="Choosing the Add to a Page option on the Embed Feed popup" class="wp-image-368778" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/reviewsfeededitor-wordpressorg-embedfeed-page.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/reviewsfeededitor-wordpressorg-embedfeed-page-300x173.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Then, you&#8217;ll select the page where you want the reviews to appear</p>



<p>Your <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/how-to-create-a-custom-homepage-in-wordpress/" title="How to Create a Custom Home Page in WordPress">home page</a> is a good start. It can use a simple list of positive reviews to create a strong first impression of trust and reliability.</p>



<p>So, let&#8217;s select the home page from the list and click the &#8216;Add&#8217; button.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="421" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/reviewsfeededitor-editor-embed-addtohome.png" alt="Adding reviews to the home page" class="wp-image-369728" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/reviewsfeededitor-editor-embed-addtohome.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/reviewsfeededitor-editor-embed-addtohome-300x186.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Next, in the <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/14-tips-for-mastering-the-wordpress-visual-editor/" title="Tips for Mastering the WordPress Content Editor">content editor</a>, you can click the &#8216;+&#8217; button to add the Reviews Feed block.</p>



<p>Go ahead and use the search bar to quickly find the block.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="409" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/blockeditor-add-reviewsfeed.png" alt="Adding Reviews Feed block" class="wp-image-369730" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/blockeditor-add-reviewsfeed.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/blockeditor-add-reviewsfeed-300x180.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>Once you add the Reviews Feed block, you&#8217;ll immediately see the preview in the editor.</p>



<p>From here, you can move around this block to any position on your page using the standard <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-use-the-new-wordpress-block-editor/" title="How to Use the WordPress Block Editor (Gutenberg Tutorial)">WordPress block editor</a> controls.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="427" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/blockeditor-add-reviewsfeed-loaded.png" alt="Reviews Feed added to the content editor" class="wp-image-369731" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/blockeditor-add-reviewsfeed-loaded.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/blockeditor-add-reviewsfeed-loaded-300x188.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p>When you&#8217;re happy with everything, hit &#8216;Save&#8217; or &#8216;Update&#8217; to publish your page.</p>



<p>Your WordPress.org reviews are now live and will automatically update as new reviews are posted to the original plugin or theme page.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="435" src="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/livesite-reviewsfeed-wordpressorg.png" alt="WordPres org reviews on a live site" class="wp-image-369735" srcset="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/livesite-reviewsfeed-wordpressorg.png 680w, https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/livesite-reviewsfeed-wordpressorg-300x192.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-bonus-step-maximize-conversions-by-featuring-reviews-on-key-pages">How to Maximize Conversions From WordPress.org Reviews</h4>



<p>Displaying your WordPress.org reviews in the <strong>right place</strong> can make a big difference in how many people install or buy your plugin or theme.</p>



<p>Here are some of the best places you can add your WordPress.org plugin or theme reviews:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>💰 <strong>Sales and product pages:</strong> Placing glowing reviews right next to your <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-add-a-buy-now-button-in-wordpress/" title="How to Add a Buy Now Button in WordPress (Easy Methods)">&#8216;Buy Now&#8217; button</a> can be the final nudge a potential customer needs.

<li>🧩 <strong><a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-create-a-landing-page-with-wordpress/" title="How to Create a Landing Page With WordPress">Landing pages</a>:</strong> When someone visits a page about a specific plugin or theme, showing reviews right away builds instant trust and helps turn interest into action.</li>



<li>🛒 <strong>Checkout pages:</strong> Even a small reviews widget with 4–5 star reviews can calm last-minute doubts and reduce cart abandonment.</li>
</ul>



<p>I’ve found that pages with well-placed reviews convert better. The key is to show the right reviews on the right pages, based on what your visitors are looking for and <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-make-a-high-converting-sales-funnel-in-wordpress/" title="How to Make a High Converting Sales Funnel in WordPress">where they are in the buying process</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="aioseo-frequently-asked-questions-about-showing-wordpress-org-reviews">Frequently Asked Questions About Showing WordPress.org Reviews</h4>



<p>Here are a few questions that readers often ask me about showing WordPress.org reviews on their websites. </p>



<p><strong>How do I ensure WordPress.org reviews are updated automatically?</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://smashballoon.com/reviews-feed" target="_blank" title="Smash Balloon Reviews Feed - #1 Customer Reviews Plugin for WordPress">Reviews Feed Pro</a> automatically synchronizes with WordPress.org to pull in new reviews as they&#8217;re posted. The plugin checks for updates on a regular schedule, so your displayed reviews stay current without you needing to do anything. </p>



<p><strong>Can I customize which WordPress.org reviews are shown?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, you can filter reviews using several different methods within the Smash Balloon plugin. You can display only reviews above a certain star rating, filter by specific keywords that appear in review text, or use the banned words feature to exclude reviews containing unwanted terms.</p>



<p><strong>What should I do if I run into an authorization error with Smash Balloon?</strong></p>



<p>Authorization errors typically occur when the WordPress.org URL isn&#8217;t properly formatted or the <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-fix-the-504-gateway-timeout-error-in-wordpress/" title="How to Fix the 504 Gateway Timeout Error in WordPress">connection has timed out</a>.</p>



<p>To fix this, you&#8217;ll want to double-check that you&#8217;ve copied the <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/website-url-parts-explained-for-beginners/" title="What Is a Website URL (Important Parts Explained for Beginners)">complete URL</a> from the plugin or theme&#8217;s WordPress.org page. Then, try reconnecting through the Smash Balloon Reviews Feed settings.</p>



<p><strong>Are there limits to the number of reviews I can display with Smash Balloon?</strong></p>



<p>The plugin doesn&#8217;t put strict limits on review numbers, but displaying too many reviews on a single page can slow down your site&#8217;s loading speed. I recommend <strong>starting with 5-10</strong> reviews per feed and testing your <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-performance-speed/" title="The Ultimate Guide to Boost WordPress Speed &amp; Performance">page performance</a> before adding more.</p>
